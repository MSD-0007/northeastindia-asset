            <h1>About The Location</h1>
            <p><strong>Sivasagar</strong>, formerly known as <strong>Rangpur</strong>, is a historic town located in the Sivasagar district of Assam, India. It served as the capital of the Ahom Kingdom for several centuries and is renowned for its rich cultural heritage. The town is known for its ancient monuments, temples, palaces, and water tanks, which reflect the grandeur of the Ahom dynasty. The name "Sivasagar," meaning "ocean of Shiva," is derived from the massive Sivasagar Tank and the Shivadol Temple, two of the town's most iconic landmarks.</p>
        
            <h2>Key Features of Sivasagar</h2>
             <li><p><strong>Historical Significance:</strong> Sivasagar was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom and a center of administration and culture. The town was renamed from Rangpur to Sivasagar in the 18th century, following the construction of the Sivasagar Tank and the Shivadol Temple. The Ahoms, originally from Southeast Asia, left a rich legacy in Assam through their architectural and cultural contributions.</p></li>
        
             <li><p><strong>Sivasagar Tank (Borpukhuri):</strong> One of the largest water bodies in Assam, the Sivasagar Tank, also known as Borpukhuri, was constructed by Queen Ambika in 1734. Covering 130 acres, it remains an important landmark surrounded by temples and serves as a serene spot in the town. The tank's engineering marvel keeps the water level consistently high throughout the year.</p></li>
        
             <li><p><strong>Shivadol Temple:</strong> Adjacent to the Sivasagar Tank, the Shivadol Temple is a towering structure dedicated to Lord Shiva. Built in 1734 by Queen Ambika, it stands 104 feet tall with a diameter of 195 feet. The temple is renowned for its Ahom architectural style, featuring a dome-like structure and a golden spire. It is one of the tallest Shiva temples in India and a prominent pilgrimage site.</p></li>
        
             <li><p><strong>Rang Ghar:</strong> Rang Ghar is an ancient amphitheater built by Ahom King Pramatta Singha in the 18th century. Known as the "Colosseum of the East," it is one of Asia's oldest surviving pavilions. The two-story structure was used for watching sports, cultural events, and animal fights, showcasing unique Ahom architectural features such as arched entryways and decorative lotus motifs.</p></li>
        
             <li><p><strong>Talatal Ghar:</strong> Talatal Ghar is a seven-story palace built by Ahom King Rudra Singha. The upper floors served as the royal residence, while the lower floors included underground tunnels used for strategic purposes and escape routes.

             <li><p><strong>Kareng Ghar (Garhgaon Palace):</strong> Located about 15 kilometers from Sivasagar, Kareng Ghar was the royal palace of the Ahom kings.
